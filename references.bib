 abstract={Many data analysis problems involve the application of a split-apply-combine strategy, where you break up a big problem into manageable pieces, operate on each piece independently and then put all the pieces back together. This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored. The paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements.},

 abstract = {This article investigates the family {Iλ;λ ∈ R} of power divergence statistics for testing the fit of observed frequencies {Xi;i = 1,...,k} to expected frequencies {Ei;i = 1,...,k}. From the definition 2nIλ = 2/λ(λ + 1) ∑ki = 1 Xi{(Xi/Ei)λ - 1}; λ ∈ R, it can easily be seen that Pearson's X2 (λ = 1), the log likelihood ratio statistic (λ = 0), the Freeman-Tukey statistic (λ = -1/2) the modified log likelihood ratio statistic (λ = -1) and the Neyman modified X2 (λ = -2), are all special cases. Most of the work presented is devoted to an analytic study of the asymptotic difference between different Iλ, however finite sample results have been presented as a check and a supplement to our conclusions. A new goodness-of-fit statistic, where λ = 2/3, emerges as an excellent and compromising alternative to the old warriors, I0 and I1.},
